## Download Yolo pretrained model from this link

## Steps:

1. Copy the search dataset to a folder
2. copy the query images to another folder
3. Launch the application (presently with python). Will soon release an exe file
4. fill the username
5. Select query folder (reference folder)
6. Select dataset folder 
7. Enter number of images to be retrieved (default 10)

8. Click on retrieve

9. you can see the images extracted inside the query images folder as a separate folder
by name same as username
10. the images extracted are ordered according to their similarity to the query image

11. press exit to close the application

Note: If the search folder is executed for the first time, it will take time to
compute features for all the images in the search set. From second time onwards
it will be very quick as the features are computed and stored from first execution


Thank you
